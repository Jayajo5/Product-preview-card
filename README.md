## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Responcive Design

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.image .responsive-image{
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    background-image: url(images/image-product-desktop.jpg);
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
    flex-shrink: 1;
 }
```

### Continued development

- In future projects will learn more CSS properties.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) - This helped me for Centering in CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flexbox) - This is an amazing free resource which helped me finally understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
